    "\n",
    "Initially, we use our salary data and the Google Maps API to find salaries of positions with the right title in the same area as the college we are examining, which requires little to no cleaning because Google Maps has very effective fuzzy search.  If no data is found, we leave expected salary as NaN.  To tie that data in with the College Score Card data, we need to match universities of the same name between data sets, so we will standardize both to an extent and modify individually as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Data Analysis*\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, we expect to be able to analyze the value a student might get from attending a particular university and choosing a particular major.  We can first examine many aspects of the data that is available to us through the college score card data set.  For example, a student with a low-income background can expect to have a higher level of financial aid and lower overall cost of attendance.  Therefore, that student might be able to get value from a degree with lower-paying job prospects.  However, a student with a high-income financial background might need to pay more to make their way through school and would therefore be limited to majors with higher expected salaries to get good value for their investment.  The score card data is also has data about retention and completion rates, so universities with very low completion rates might have a lower \"expected\" value given the higher chance of not completing.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this data, we can perform some unsupervised learning to group these university-major pairings into low, medium, and high value education investments.  We can then look at the schools or majors which most commonly show up in the highest value category to give general recommendations, or look at the highest value specific pairings to make more specific recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What to report*\n",
    "\n",
    "We will report the categories we find in the university-major pairings and which category each pairing falls in.

    "The data we are using is publicly available for download and comes with permission to use it.  For our salary data, we are only using a salary and city to perform data analysis, which is not enough to de-anonymize anyone.  The college score card data is only data relative to colleges in general, though the data has many categories profiling the student body.  These include things like financial background and race, but the only data included is statistics about the student body as a whole, so there shouldn't be any information about any particular individual in that data.  There is a remote possibility of looking at a school with very low population, and maybe a population of only 3 of a particular race.  In such a case, there may be a possibility of identifying individuals.  However, we are only looking at the top 50 or so universities which all have reasonably large student bodies, so I don't expect this to be a possibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of biases in the data, we don't have the possibility for much.  Our salary data is taken directly from those reporting, so it is possible that it will skew higher, as people with lower salaries may not want to report theirs.  The college score card data is purely statistics about the student body, so there is little room for bias or interpretation there."

We want each person to have a list of which colleges specialize in the program they intend to study, that will also offer information for each institution's general salary outcome in their proposed department. We would also like to help our users consider the financial impact of their decision, as young adults may not be aware of the specific price range of housing/tuition versus the salary they will recieve when they gradute. The goal is to give options, with a personalized list of the best colleges for the perceived department in rank order 1-50, the average salary after graduating and the total financial cost of housing/tuition.\n",

    "A potential pitfall of our data is that it does not include the student's demographics. For example, maybe a student of a certain racial or economic background is less likely to get into a specific college or get a job after graduating. The numbers included in our data sets are averages; therefore, we can only give suggestions for the average student on which college is best for them. Also, we do not take into account where the student might prefer to live. The best college option for a student might be in a different state or somewhere they do not wish to live."
